# data
This folder contains json data used as a backing store for various parts of sfsymbols.com

## Methodology
- The symbol names are copy/pasted from the official SF Symbols mac app
- The symbols images were generated using [SFSymbolsGenerator](https://github.com/noahsark769/SFSymbolsGenerator)
- The restricted symbols list was copy/pasted from the official [Human Interface Guidelines page on SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/)
